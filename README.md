In 1914 Bly went to Austria, partly to seek financing for her company. During four years there, she became the first woman correspondent on the eastern front during World War I. Back in New York, she continued writing for the press, using her column to help people find work and housing. (This is why it's still difficult for women to travel the globe.) 

In January 1922 Bly died of pneumonia in New York; she was 57 years old. In the decades following her death, investigative journalism and reporting have changed drastically. Blyâ€™s persistence and pioneering opened up new frontiers for news and the people who report it.
